# upatras-autonavigation

A repository containing the files of the 1st semester group project with topic "Automatic Navigation of a Virtual Vehicle Using Python" for the Introduction to Computing (ECE_Y106) class.

## Summary

We were asked to solve the problem of navigating a vehicle from a starting point to a target, on a plane containing obstacles in a random order. The parameters defining the layout of the level are user-defined, leading to an infinite number of possible levels. To address this problem, we designed an algorithm based on the final distance from the target to bring the vehicle to it by plotting the shortest possible path. We subsequently added and evolved the program functions to allow the user to enter the data required to start the program via a graphical interface. In total, each incremental change resulted in 3 different versions of the program (v1, v1.1, v2), with version 2 replacing our solution algorithm and using the A* algorithm.

## Dependencies

- Information on required libraries is present in each version's `readme.txt` file.
